## Some Background

- Software Engineering/CS recruiting tends to be inconsistent and tedious
- Goal: centralize end-to-end SWE recruiting process into one app

## Design Goals

**Reduce Redundancy**:
The app should enable users to enter demographic info once and reuse  for each application

**Application Status Tracking**:
The app should maintain and update the status of users’ applications, displaying them in an organized way

**Internal Company Search & Apply**:
Users should be able to search for companies that match their interests and apply to them within the app

## Feedback

Feedback for Dashboard
- Suggested colors be more dynamic than the 2 main site colors
- Suggested Company Icons because participant dislikes “walls of text”
- Liked Kanban-style job application status dashboard because he sees it a lot on software teams
- Liked our description that the status was “automatically updated”

Feedback for Job Search
- Suggested that “Apply Now” button be visible plain and center (without need for scrolling down)
- Was confused about which position from sidebar was being displayed on main screen; this prompted us to highlight current selection
- Recommended adding filter for company’s ability to sponsor visa 
- Expressed interest in being able to “save for later”; prompted ‘pin’ 

Feedback for Application Page
- Layout was easy to use and intuitive
- Specifically addressed pain point of application tracker and FAQ
- Dashboard feature reminded participant of their Notion board
- Suggested to include recruiter’s direct contact in addition to contact form

Feedback for Profile
- Suggested that there was a dark mode for at least the profile page because there was “too much white”
- Wanted dropdown lists instead of text fields for Profile->Common Information
- Suggested that the profile page displayed your current resume and had a way of creating a new one from one of the app’s provided templates.
